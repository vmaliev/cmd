# Overview  
The IT Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline IT support operations, manage user requests, and provide efficient ticket tracking and resolution workflows. The system serves IT administrators, support technicians, and end users, providing a centralized hub for all IT-related activities and communications.

# Core Features  
## User Authentication & Role Management
- Secure login system with role-based access control
- User roles: Administrators, IT Technicians, End Users
- Session management and security features

## Ticket Management System
- Create, track, and manage support tickets
- Priority levels and categorization
- Status tracking (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
- Assignment and escalation workflows

## Knowledge Base & Documentation
- Centralized documentation repository
- Searchable knowledge base
- FAQ management
- Solution templates for common issues

## Asset Management
- IT asset inventory tracking
- Hardware and software license management
- Maintenance schedules and history
- Asset lifecycle management

## Reporting & Analytics
- Dashboard with key metrics and KPIs
- Ticket resolution time analytics
- User satisfaction tracking
- Performance reports for IT staff

## Communication Tools
- Internal messaging system
- Email notifications and alerts
- Status update notifications
- Integration with external communication tools

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **IT Administrators**: Manage system configuration, user accounts, and oversee operations
- **IT Technicians**: Handle ticket resolution, maintain knowledge base, and provide support
- **End Users**: Submit tickets, track progress, and access self-service resources

## Key User Flows
1. **Ticket Submission**: User logs in → Selects category → Fills form → Submits ticket → Receives confirmation
2. **Ticket Resolution**: Technician receives assignment → Updates status → Resolves issue → Closes ticket
3. **Knowledge Base Access**: User searches → Views articles → Applies solutions → Provides feedback

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive interface with responsive design
- Mobile-friendly access for field technicians
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Consistent design language and navigation

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Phase 1)
- Authentication system must be built first as it's required for all other features
- Database schema design is critical for all subsequent development
- Basic user management enables proper access control

## Core Functionality (Phase 2)
- Ticket management is the primary feature that provides immediate value
- Status workflow enables proper ticket lifecycle management
- Assignment system allows for proper task distribution

## User Experience (Phase 3)
- Web interface makes the system accessible and usable
- Dashboard provides visibility into system status
- Search capabilities improve user efficiency

## Knowledge Enhancement (Phase 4)
- Knowledge base builds upon ticket data to create reusable solutions
- Search functionality leverages existing search infrastructure
- Content management enables self-service support

## Asset Integration (Phase 5)
- Asset management connects to tickets for better context
- Maintenance scheduling builds upon existing notification system
- License tracking provides compliance capabilities

## Analytics & Insights (Phase 6)
- Reporting builds upon all existing data
- Analytics provide value from accumulated system usage
- Export capabilities enable external analysis

## Polish & Scale (Phase 7)
- Optimization improves performance for larger datasets
- Security enhancements protect accumulated data
- Advanced features leverage existing infrastructure

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complex database relationships between tickets, users, and assets
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple schema, iterate based on usage patterns

- **Risk**: Real-time notifications and updates
- **Mitigation**: Begin with email notifications, add real-time features later

- **Risk**: File upload security and storage management
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper validation, use cloud storage for production

## MVP Definition
- **Core MVP**: Authentication + Basic ticket management + Simple web interface
- **Success Criteria**: Users can submit tickets, technicians can resolve them
- **Scope Control**: Focus on essential features, defer advanced analytics

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited development time and resources
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize features by user value, use existing libraries
- **Risk**: Complex integrations with external systems
- **Mitigation**: Start with standalone system, add integrations incrementally
