- Support for multiple trading strategies (options, spot, futures)
- Real-time position monitoring and management
- Integration with Bybit API for order placement and account management

## Risk Management System
- Position sizing based on account balance and risk parameters
- Stop-loss and take-profit automation
- Maximum drawdown protection
- Portfolio exposure limits

## Web Interface
- Real-time dashboard for monitoring trades and account status
- Configuration management interface
- Historical trade analysis and reporting
- User authentication and security

## Notification System
- Email alerts for trade executions and errors
- Webhook status monitoring
- System health notifications

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Trading Engine**: Core logic for strategy execution and order management
- **API Layer**: Bybit API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- **Webhook Server**: Secure endpoint for receiving TradingView alerts
- **Database**: Trade history, configuration, and performance metrics
- **Web Interface**: React-based dashboard for user interaction
- **Notification System**: Email and webhook status alerts

## Data Models
- **Trade**: Order details, execution status, P&L tracking
- **Strategy**: Configuration, parameters, performance metrics
- **Account**: Balance, positions, risk settings
- **Signal**: Webhook data, validation, processing status

## APIs and Integrations
- Bybit REST API for trading operations
- TradingView webhook integration
- Email service for notifications
- Optional: Additional exchange APIs for multi-exchange support

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Node.js runtime environment
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- SSL certificates for secure webhook communication
- Docker containerization for deployment
- Logging and monitoring systems

- Simple web interface for configuration
- Basic logging and error handling

## Phase 2: Core Trading Features
- Advanced order types (limit, stop-loss, take-profit)
- Position sizing algorithm implementation
- Risk management rules and validation
- Trade history tracking and basic reporting
- Enhanced web interface with real-time updates

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multiple strategy support
- Advanced risk management (drawdown protection, portfolio limits)
- Performance analytics and reporting
- Email notification system
- Mobile-responsive web interface

## Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Security hardening (API key encryption, input validation)
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Documentation and deployment guides
- Testing suite and quality assurance

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Phase 1)
1. **API Integration**: Bybit client setup and authentication
2. **Basic Webhook**: Simple endpoint to receive and validate signals
3. **Order Execution**: Basic market order placement
4. **Web Interface**: Minimal configuration and status display

## Build Upon Foundation (Phase 2)
1. **Enhanced Orders**: Add limit orders and stop-loss functionality
2. **Position Management**: Track and manage open positions
3. **Risk Controls**: Implement position sizing and basic risk rules
4. **Data Persistence**: Store trades and configuration

## Advanced Features (Phase 3)
1. **Multiple Strategies**: Support for different trading approaches
2. **Advanced Risk Management**: Portfolio-level controls
3. **Analytics**: Performance tracking and reporting
4. **Notifications**: Email alerts and system monitoring

## Production Polish (Phase 4)
1. **Security**: API key encryption, input validation, audit logging
2. **Reliability**: Error handling, recovery mechanisms, monitoring
3. **Performance**: Optimization, caching, rate limiting
4. **Documentation**: User guides, API documentation, deployment

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **Webhook Security**: Validate webhook signatures and implement IP whitelisting
- **Order Execution Failures**: Robust error handling and order status tracking
- **Data Consistency**: Proper database transactions and rollback mechanisms

## MVP Scope Management
- **Start Simple**: Focus on market orders before complex order types
- **Single Exchange**: Begin with Bybit only, expand later
- **Basic Risk Management**: Implement essential controls first
- **Minimal UI**: Functional interface before advanced features

## Resource Constraints
- **Development Time**: Prioritize core trading functionality over nice-to-have features
- **Testing**: Focus on critical path testing for trading operations
- **Documentation**: Maintain essential documentation for deployment and usage
